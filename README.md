Over the next few days I will be uploading my Codewars Progress. Some of the beginner exercises are a little elementary so I include some of the 7th and 8th level Katas but not all of them because some are just very entry level.

After they're all here, I'll begin to add my daily codewars exercises to my github for any curious parties.
