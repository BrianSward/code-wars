- Over the next few days I will be uploading my Codewars Progress. Some of the beginner exercises are a little elementary so I include some of the 7th and 8th level Katas but not all of them because some are just very entry level.

- After they're all here, I'll begin to add my daily codewars exercises to my github for any curious parties.
